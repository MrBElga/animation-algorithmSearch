This repository showcases animated implementations of two popular sorting algorithms: Counting Sort and Tim Sort.

Counting Sort is a linear time sorting algorithm that operates by counting the number of occurrences of each unique element in the input array. Tim Sort, on the other hand, is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, designed to perform well on many kinds of real-world data.

The animations provided here offer a visual representation of how these algorithms work step by step, aiding in understanding their mechanisms and efficiency
